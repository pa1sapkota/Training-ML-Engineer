# Lambda Data Processing Function

This AWS Lambda function retrieves data from a remote API, processes it, and uploads the results to an Amazon S3 bucket. The function is written in Python and uses various AWS services, including S3 and urllib3, to accomplish its tasks.

## Functionality

1. The Lambda function makes an HTTP GET request to a specified URL to retrieve JSON data.
2. The retrieved JSON data is stored in a raw data bucket in Amazon S3.
3. The function applies data transformations on the JSON data using pandas.
4. The transformed data is stored as a CSV file in a clean data bucket in Amazon S3.
5. Logging is used to capture and record important events and errors.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with necessary IAM permissions to create and invoke Lambda functions, and access to S3 buckets.
- Python knowledge and experience.
- Familiarity with AWS Lambda, S3, and API requests.

## Setup

1. Create an IAM role with permissions to access S3 and any other necessary services. Attach this role to your Lambda function.
2. Deploy the Lambda function using the AWS Lambda Console, AWS CLI, or your preferred deployment method.
3. Make sure to configure environment variables, such as the S3 bucket names and the API URL, in the Lambda function.
4. Monitor the CloudWatch logs to track the execution of the Lambda function and identify any issues.

## Usage

1. When the Lambda function is triggered, it will fetch JSON data from the specified API URL.
2. The raw JSON data will be stored in the specified S3 bucket for archival.
3. The function will apply data transformations using pandas, and the resulting CSV data will be stored in another S3 bucket.
4. Check the CloudWatch logs for any errors or warnings encountered during the execution.
