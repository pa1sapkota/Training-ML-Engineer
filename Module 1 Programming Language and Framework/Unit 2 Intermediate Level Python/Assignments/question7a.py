import csv

# Read data from the original CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'r') as input_file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(input_file)
    data = list(reader)
# print(data)

# writing the adult in the adult.csv
with open('adult.csv', 'w') as output_file: 
    fieldnames = ['Name', 'Age']
    writer= csv.DictWriter(output_file, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
