'''
Build a Python class to represent a simple banking system. Create a class for a
BankAccount, and another for Customer. The BankAccount class should have a
constructor to initialize the account details (account number, balance, account type).
The Customer class should have a constructor to set the customer's details (name,
age, address) and create a BankAccount object for each customer. Implement a
destructor for both classes to display a message when objects are destroyed.

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance, account_type):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.balance = balance
        self.account_type = account_type

    def __del__(self):
        print(f"BankAccount {self.account_number} has been closed.")


class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name, age, address):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.address = address
        self.bank_account = None

    def create_account(self, account_number, balance, account_type):
        # Using Aggregation 
        self.bank_account = BankAccount(account_number, balance, account_type)

    def __del__(self):
        print(f"Customer {self.name} has been removed from records.")


# Example usage
customer1 = Customer("Wednesday", 30, "221 b Baker St")
customer1.create_account("00985554785", 1000, "Savings")


# Simulating removal of customers
del customer1
