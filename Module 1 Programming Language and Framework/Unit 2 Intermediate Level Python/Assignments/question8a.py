'''
Create a Python class to represent a University. The university should have
attributes like name, location, and a list of departments. Implement encapsulation to
protect the internal data of the University class. Create a Department class that
inherits from the University class. The Department class should have attributes like
department name, head of the department, and a list of courses offered. Implement
polymorphism by defining a common method for both the University and
Department classes to display their details.
